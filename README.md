# Scientific-Calculator  
  
A simulation of a Scientific Calculator using JAVA (with GUI).

Unzip the file or import the project to your IDE Workspace. File is zipped because the number of files is > 100 and I'm to busy (lazy lol) to re upload the whole thing.  

You can run the Executable Jar to test the calculator.
